Program 7: Develop a MongoDB query for comparison selectors, Logical Selectors for Company database

$mongosh
## Setup: Sample employees Collection 🏢
First, let's insert some sample data into an employees collection to use for our queries.

db.employees.insertMany([
  {
    employee_id: 101,
    name: "Sonia Rao",
    department: "Engineering",
    salary: 95000,
    hire_date: new Date("2023-01-15"),
    performance_score: 4.5,
    status: "Active"
  },   {
    employee_id: 102,
    name: "Rajesh Kumar",
    department: "HR",
    salary: 68000,
    hire_date: new Date("2024-03-22"),
    performance_score: 4.1,
    status: "Active"
  },   {
    employee_id: 103,
    name: "Arjun Singh",
    department: "Engineering",
    salary: 120000,
    hire_date: new Date("2022-06-01"),
    performance_score: 4.8,
    status: "Active"
  },   {
    employee_id: 104,
    name: "Priya Mehta",
    department: "Sales",
    salary: 85000,
    hire_date: new Date("2023-11-10"),
    performance_score: 4.2,
    status: "Active"
  },   {
    employee_id: 105,
    name: "Vikram Reddy",
    department: "Sales",
    salary: 85000,
    hire_date: new Date("2024-08-01"),
    status: "On Leave"
  }
]);

## 1. Comparison Selectors ⚙️
These operators compare the value of a field against a specified value.
$gt (Greater Than) & $lte (Less Than or Equal To)
	Goal: Find all employees with a salary greater than $90,000 but less than or equal to $120,000.
	Query:
db.employees.find({
  salary: { $gt: 90000, $lte: 120000 }
})
	Explanation: This query finds documents where the salary is between 90,001 and 120,000, inclusive. It will find Sonia Rao and Arjun Singh.
$in (In an Array)
	Goal: Find all employees who work in either the "HR" or "Sales" department.
	Query:
db.employees.find({
  department: { $in: ["HR", "Sales"] }
})
	Explanation: The $in operator selects documents where the department field's value exactly matches any value in the provided array. It will find Rajesh Kumar, Priya Mehta, and Vikram Reddy.
$ne (Not Equal)
	Goal: Find all employees whose status is not "On Leave".
	Query:
db.employees.find({
  status: { $ne: "On Leave" }
})
	Explanation: The $ne operator selects all documents where the status field value is not equal to the specified value.

## 2. Logical Selectors 
These operators are used to combine multiple query conditions.
$and (Implicit)
	Goal: Find employees in the "Engineering" department with a performance_score of 4.5 or higher.
	Query:
db.employees.find({
  department: "Engineering",
  performance_score: { $gte: 4.5 }
})
	Explanation: When you list multiple fields separated by a comma in a find() query, MongoDB treats it as an $and condition by default. This is the most common way to combine conditions. This query will find Sonia Rao and Arjun Singh.
$or
	Goal: Find employees who are either in the "HR" department OR have a salary greater than $100,000.
	Query:
db.employees.find({
  $or: [
    { department: "HR" },
    { salary: { $gt: 100000 } }
  ]
})
	Explanation: The $or operator takes an array of condition objects and selects documents that satisfy at least one of the conditions. This will find Rajesh Kumar (matches department) and Arjun Singh (matches salary).
## 3. Combining Selectors for a Complex Query ✨
Real-world scenarios often require combining multiple operators.
	Goal: Find all Active employees in either the Engineering or Sales departments who were hired before 2024.
	Query:
db.employees.find({
  status: "Active",
  department: { $in: ["Engineering", "Sales"] },
  hire_date: { $lt: new Date("2024-01-01") }
})
Explanation: This query implicitly uses $and to combine three conditions:
1.	The status must be "Active".
2.	The department must be one of the values in the $in array
3.	The hire_date must be less than ($lt) the specified date
